While exploring APIs and their use in Rails apps, I used the weather underground API to get the temperature and the humidity of all zipcodes of the USA. The user inputs their zipcode, and  based on the temperature and humidity, the  webapp will output the kind of hair they will be getting ( frizzy, unmanageable, standard or diva) The responses are given as funny gifs.
